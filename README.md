### Obejective

Design and implement an Arduino-based traffic light controller integrated with a pedestrian crossing system, focused on safety, accessibility, and real-time feedback. The system must:
- Control standard vehicle traffic lights (Red, Yellow, Green) in a timed sequence.
- Include a pedestrian crossing, activated by a pushbutton.
- Provide a visual countdown timer using a 7-segment display, always showing the remaining time for the current phase(vehicle or pedestrian).
- Sound a buzzer at the start and end of the pedestrian crossing phase to aid visually impaired users.
- Blink the pedestrian green LED during the last seconds of the crossing phase as a warning.
